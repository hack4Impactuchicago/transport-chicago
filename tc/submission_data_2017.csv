Mobility is critical to economic and social development and must therefore be accessible and affordable to everyone. Driverless vehicles promise a leap in productivity, but at the same time threaten the industrial base and related jobs in view of digital business models, automation and new forms of ownership. At the same time, the digital transformation promises a future where mobility is not only sustainable and zero emission, but shared and available on demand in a highly customized fashion. Such personalization of mobility services relies on data and the ability to translate such data into products and services that consumer‰Ûªs value. Data has become the ultimate control point and is at the center of emerging business models. What are the future business models in this emerging ecosystem of mobility?<br /><br /> The Blockchain promises a future where personal identities and data can be protected. At the same time, identities and trust protocols enable a true P2P sharing economy without impacting privacy. It may enable data sharing across value chain participants in a way that puts consumers and commons in control of data and how it may be shared (and in exchange for what). Ultimately, the Blockchain promises to power not only humans, but autonomous fleets that create a self-governing marketplace of mobility and transportation services. <br /><br />With Illinois' focus on Blockchain (IL Liaison, pilot at Cook County, IDOT looking for use cases) we see this highly relevant.",Blockchain; New Mobility,"t is still a long way before driverless fleets of next generation vehicles roam the streets to serve our individual mobility needs. But the New Mobility revolution is well on its way and the digital transformation of the industry is accelerating. Based on our conversations with companies across the New Mobility ecosystem, we have established the following three audience categories. 1.	Those that have heard of the Blockchain in the context of crypto-currencies and the Banking industry, but have only a vague understanding of the technology and its underpinnings. 2.	The second category are companies that have started to explore the technology, typically as part of a research lab. However, these efforts are typically limited in terms of resource commitment and lack the scale to do justice to the opportunity presented by the technology. 3.	Lastly, the Blockchain leaders in our network have developed a solid understanding of the technology and related use cases in their business context. They are actively engaged in the Blockchain ecosystem and are testing the limits of the technology in prototypes and real-life deployments. ","As much as the category 3 leaders are concerned about giving up their hard- earned lessons and experiences, they are also keenly aware that it takes a cross- industry effort and the collaboration of multiple players to accelerate the adoption and commercialization of Blockchain in New Mobility. The goal of the presentation is to foster a discussion on how the Blockchain can unleash its full potential in the mobility and transportation space for the benefit of your members, citizens, and societies at large. A logical next step could be the creation of a special interest group to coordinate the Blockchain in New Mobility efforts of your Business Advisory Council members, where faculty, students and external consultants contribute and share experiences for the benefit of all members incl. commercialization.",See above,Full Session,,,,,,,

Specifically, this study sought to identify the safety benefit from traffic signal coordination projects on major arterial roadways through urban areas using a before and after study with comparison groups approach and a Meta-Analysis method.  The findings suggest that traffic signal coordination could decrease total crashes by 2 percent, injury crashes by 26 percent and property-damage-only crashes by 9 percent.  The results can be directly applied by engineering practitioners to quantify the safety benefits for projects that seek to coordinate traffic signals along an urban corridor.  Because traffic signal coordination projects can both improve the safety of roadways while improving traffic flow, the application of these findings could be broad.

Hence, the government is actively looking for alternative funding sources to support infrastructure development.<br /><br />One of the funding sources being looked upon by many states is vehicle registration fee. Several states such as Texas (Byknish D.,2017) and Michigan (Foley S, 2016) have recently increased the registration fee and others states are considering the same. Illinois had a major hike in vehicle registration fee last in 2010 by $20 and further increased it in 2014 by $2 to support state transportation infrastructure (Clout S., Ray L., 2012; Riopell M., 2009). However, an increase in vehicle registration fee can also alter travel behavior. Hence, it is important to understand implications of change in vehicle registration fee from policy perspective.<br /><br /> The study aims at exploring impact of vehicle registration fee on Vehicle Miles Travelled (VMT) per capita and household vehicle ownership across counties of Texas, as the fee varies by county and has been increased by $1.75 in 2017. The impact is measured using Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression technique by using National Household Travel Survey, 2009 data. The findings help in understanding utility of vehicle registration fee as a funding source as compared to a demand management technique. The results show that vehicle registration fee does impact VMT, whereas there is no statistically significant impact on vehicle ownership. Hence, vehicle registration fee has no impact on travel behavior as it gets marginalized over the use of vehicle in the year. The VMT finding reflects impact from other user fees.<br /><br />References<br />*Byknish D. (2017, January 25) Texas vehicle registration fee increases by $3.75, unless you do it online. Kxan.

It is simpler to segregate the atypical days, maintaining a clean and well behaved ordinary daily travel model. However, it creates an arbitrary distinction at the modeling interface, where crossing the invisible boundary implies a sudden behavioral shift<br /><br />.*Approach*<br />For Colorado, we adopted a different approach: fusing both ordinary and extraordinary into a single model.  This was done because imposing any reasonable cutoff to differentiate these two models would move substantial portions of the daily commuting and other normal tours into the long-distance realm.  Two important challenges arise from building this kind of fused model using a traditional household travel survey: the proper handling of non-closed tours (e.g. overnight travel) in the daily activity diary survey, and the fusion of single-day diary household survey data with longer period long distance survey data.<br /><br />*Findings*<br />We encountered a number of challenges in processing the data: correct weighting of long distance log data, the absence of other daily activity matching the long-distance travel, and especially the handling of closed overnight tours, which appear in the data temporally reversed (e.g. come home from work, later leave home to go to work). Overnight tours proved especially challenging in time-of-day models, as they violate the usual constraints.

The fortunes of these services waned during the 1930s as a result of the Depression.  By 1962, the last of these companies had been absorbed into the local transit system.<br /><br />	Nevertheless, the basic principle of differentiated service remains valid.  Modern experience in big cities shows that transit customers will use limited-strop urban bus route - the functional equivalent of the urban motor coach - if these services are available.  In this regard, the transit industry is coming full circle with an increased interest in differentiated bus services for different market segments.",Bus Transit,"In larger cities, bus services that provide different types of service for different markets may be better at attracting customers than a one-size-fits-all approach.","Particularly in Chicago, New York, Los Angeles, and Washington, several corridors that attracted investment by bus companies in the 1920s remain very busy for transit.","When the transit industry was still growing and developing in the 1920s, the urban motor coach grew rapidly to serve market niches.

Harper Ave.,,Chicago,IL,60637-1830,US,773-955-1848,,Redesigning Main Lines for Commuter Rail Electrification,"After decades of relative inactivity, interest in commuter rail electrification is growing.  Long limited to already-electrified systems in New York, Philadelphia, Pa., Chicago, Ill, and Montreal, Que., Canada, commuter rail electrification is increasingly recognized as a way to increase speed and train throughput on busier properties.  Several commuter railroads are planning or implementing new electrification, which presents challenges as well as opportunities.  Installing overhead wires and support structures will make track alignments essentially final for the foreseeable future.  Therefore, railroads should make any proposed changes to track layout and elevation before electrifying.  Other right-of-way considerations are also noted.	As interest in commuter rail electrification grows, best practices from early 20th century projects such as the Illinois Central electrification in Chicago will be relevant for future installations.  Between the 1900s and the 1930s, railroads electrifying their suburban and intercity passenger operations found ways to accommodate different types of trains, meet the needs of peak-period service, and keep different types of trains out of each other's way, to the maximum extent possible.  Alternatives for track arrangements are examined in the context of operating and right-of-way needs of the railroads implementing each configuration.",Commuter rail,"Electrification is costly, and often not favored by freight railroads.  Nevertheless, electric traction is the most efficient technology for very frequent service.","Until Denver opened a new-start electrified commuter railroad, no new commuter rail electrifications have occurred in North America since the early 1930s.  Therefore, the extensive civil engineering work that railroads did to rearrange tracks and raise capacity when electrifying remains a guide to best practice.","Although an inside-local, outside-express configuration such as Metra Electric has is difficult to implement, it offers the best operating results.",Panel Presentation,,,,,,,

Major auto manufacturers currently employ automated features such as adaptive cruise control, automated breaking, and lane departure warning. Furthermore, numerous auto manufacturers and information technology companies have started to test their more advanced automated vehicles (AVs) on existing roads under certain, controlled conditions.  AVs are promoted as the solution to improve safety, increase road capacity, and decrease the energy consumption and pollution once enough AVs are on the road.<br /><br />However, AV technology provides greater advantages for Freight transportation because of substantial reductions in fuel costs, increased flexibility, and greater productivity including possible increased hours of operations. Consequently, as automation technology is being developed and tested rapidly with passenger cars, the technology is being implemented in trucking even more quickly.  Extensive demonstrations in Europe and Asia in the past few years have accelerated the commercial introduction of AV technologies.<br /><br />  Achieving the promise of AV technology requires careful and focused policymaking at both the state and the federal levels.

Malthouse: Northwestern University",Neighborhood Crime and Bike-Share Station Activity:  Evidence from Chicago,"The main motivation behind this work stems from both urban sustainability and the role of transportation therein. Growing awareness of the role of active travel (walking and biking) in promoting safer, healthier and more sustainable societies motivates looking into the dynamics behind active travel as well as implementing policies to enhance it. In the United States, in particular, the introduction of bike-share systems, or the shared use of a public bike fleets, is one such effort that is gaining momentum. And while research has looked into multiple aspects of bike-sharing, the focus on the role of crimes and criminal activity within the vicinity of bike-share stations is still limited. This is especially important, in areas of relatively elevated crime activity such as Chicago. Using publicly available data for 3-year period of bike share activity for 300 stations in Chicago (Illinois), this work addresses this limitation and examines the extent to which crime activity around a station may affect the number of trips generated from that station. Considering that some unobserved effects are correlated over time and can affect bike-share activity, a time-series regression model that controls for serial correlation in the data was used. This model was compared and found superior to ordinary-least-squares model. The results derived from the model first confirm the significance of the role of crime activity on bike-share station use and second establish that this impact depends on the type of crimes around a station. The implication of these results is that neighborhood crime data should also factor into location decisions for bike stations. Such informed decisions can promote biking, shared mobility culture and in turn more sustainable environments.",Sustainability; Shared Mobility; Biking; Physical environment; Crimes; Spatial patterns ,"Participants will learn about the most important determinants of bike-share activity as found in the literature in general, and understand their role in impacting bike-share trips in the city of Chicago in particular.

With a fleet of fully-autonomous vehicles (AVs), these companies, or a transit agency operating an AV fleet, can lower their costs and offer travelers lower prices. In addition to the safety benefits of AVs, the potential benefits of AV fleets include reduced transportation costs, a solution to the first/last mile transit problem, and higher quality transportation options for individuals that either cannot operate, or afford to own, a vehicle. <br /><br />This research employs an agent-based microsimulation tool to model travelers, AVs, and the decisions of an AV fleet operator. Matching traveler requests to AVs and routing/scheduling AVs to pick up and deliver travelers are computationally challenging optimization problems. The microsimulation tool, with an embedded optimization solver, is used to analyze the operational efficiency (i.e. cost) and service quality (e.g. wait time) of AV fleet management strategies. The AV-traveler matching strategies analyzed include the simplistic first-come-first-serve (FCFS) strategy formerly used by taxi dispatchers, matching traveler requests to the nearest idle AV, and less-myopic strategies that allow AVs to divert away from the traveler they are currently traveling to pick up. The research also tests ridesharing strategies/algorithms.<br /><br />The simulation results strongly suggest that more-advanced (i.e. less-myopic) strategies can significantly reduce costs and wait times, compared with FCFS or assigning travelers to the nearest idle AV. The results also show that ridesharing significantly reduces fleet VMT and passenger wait times, relative to one vehicle-one traveler request services. ",Autonomous Vehicles; Driverless Cars; Shared-Mobility; Simulation; Optimization; Fleet Management; Ridesharing,"Participants will learn about the modeling, simulation, and analysis of autonomous vehicle fleets for passenger transportation service.","Participants will learn about the benefits of customizable agent-based microsimulation tools; specifically, the ability to embed optimization solvers within a simulation tool.","Conceptually, the presentation will provide audience members with a comprehensive means of thinking about autonomous vehicle fleets (specifically managing the fleets) at the operational level. Moreover, the results show clear benefits of using optimization-based strategies to operate vehicle fleets, compared to simple heuristic rules.",Panel Presentation,,,,,,,

Ideally conducted over a period of six years, this measure requires accurate crash and bicycle counts.  Illinois already has a robust crash reporting system, conducted by local police agencies and collected by the State of Illinois.  However, bicycle counts are sporadic and lacking.  Without bicycle counts, there is no indication of whether changes in crashes at a facility were the result of increased usage, the facility, or other factors.<br /><br />While examining separated bicycle lane facilities across Chicago for the Illinois Department of Transportation, Primera Engineers collected individual bicycle counts conducted by the City of Chicago and developed an average annual daily bicyclist conversion factors to convert short term location counts to annual counts for use in the crash analyses.  However, AADB conversion factors should be calculated each year using a wider dataset than what was available.  Furthermore, individual project counts were incomplete with some missing years prior to installation of the facility.<br /><br />Therefore, to solve this challenge of incomplete data, a permanent, regimented counting program should be developed.  The objective of this panel is to gather government and industry leaders together to discuss the state of bicycle counts in Northeast Illinois, challenges and opportunities for further development, and how to arrive at a robust, region-wide bicycle counting program leveraging existing equipment and programs, and building an open dataset useful for planners and engineers across the region .",Bicycle; bike; pedestrian; count; bike volumes; crashes; crash analysis,"Participants will learn about the current state of counting in Northeast Illinois and other states.
