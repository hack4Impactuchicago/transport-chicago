Does transit centered crime reduce ridership? Using a difference-in-difference approach, I look at whether Chicago Transit Authority (CTA)  light rail ridership responds after criminal activity at  CTA train stations. I look at three margins of response that individuals are likely to adjust their behavior on: ridership after crime event at a CTA train station, neighborhood taxi cab usage after crime event at CTA stations, change in night ridership after crime event, and change in monthly pass purchases. Using monthly and daily pass purchases, I can attribute the effect to changes in infrequent users vs frequent users.  Not much work has been done looking at the short term response of riders to crime behavior or at calculating the avoidance cost of particular events. Using a large panel data set of Chicago Transit Stations ridership and Chicago Police geocoded data, I can measure responses to different crime and how the effect varies by demographic characteristics of neighborhoods. This paper follows the framework of the work done by Becker and Rubinstein but applies it to a US context with a more comment treatment. <br /><br />
This paper measures the avoidance cost associated with transit related crime and measures the persistence of avoidance behavior. The results of this paper can be used to calculate potential reduced revenue from transit related crime and  adjust cost benefit analysis for crime reducing intervention. <br /><br />

The Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) carries each day about 2 million people, being the second largest transit system in the country. As the CTA system has to provide a fast, open and massive service, it may be chosen by terrorists as a target that guarantees effectiveness in number of casualties, as well as anonymity. Besides human casualties, a terrorist attack in the CTA system would have negative consequences for the entire city of Chicago, such as strong reduction in tourism, decrease in transit ridership, possible economic slowdown, and a general paranoia among the population. <br /><br />
The proposed poster will show a synthesis of a comprehensive security plan in order to protect the CTA rail system against possible terrorist attacks. Since it is widely recognized that it is impossible to fight terrorism only through law enforcement, the poster will show numerous other variables, which include new funding schemes, the use of design to prevent attacks on existing and new subway stations, technology to detect biological threats and improve surveillance, the role of artificial intelligence in public transit, as well as awareness campaigns, and ways to enhance the perception of security.<br /><br />

",Cook County Freight Plan ,"Building on the Connecting Cook County long range transportation plan adopted in 2016, the Cook County Freight Plan presents an opportunity to explore in detail one of its key policy areas.  Like the long-range transportation plan, the Cook County Freight Plan takes a holistic view to the performance of the entire freight system in Cook County, and is not restricted to facilities under the jurisdiction of the Department of Transportation and Highways.<br /><br />
Synthesizing technical analyses into transportation, land use, and economic data, along with stakeholder outreach and a review of the existing institutional context, the Cook County Freight Plan will articulate the role of the County in supporting the freight system.  It will identify locations on the transportation system in need of investment, describe the types of projects that the County is well suited to spearhead, and identify key partnerships necessary for successful implementation.  While primarily focused on freight transportation topics, the Cook County Freight Plan will also provide guidance on industrial and logistics redevelopment challenges and opportunities in the County, as well as freight workforce needs and recommendations.  The Cook County Freight Plan is anticipated for adoption later in 2018.  <br /><br />

However, opportunities for participation in bicycling, or bikeability, is often not equitable across neighborhoods, even within a city. Little is known in the literature regarding bicycling as a health behavior and the equity, or fairness, in bicycling opportunities. Assessment tools geared toward addressing equity in bicycling opportunities are needed.<br /><br />
Statement: The purpose of this project is to: (1) develop a tool to assess equity in bicycling opportunities at the neighborhood level, (2) pilot an observational street-level tool to assess the equity for bicycling from a cyclist perspective, and (3) to evaluate the equity of bicycling in Chicago’s predominantly Spanish-speaking communities, using the developed tool.  <br /><br />
Using non-English language as a proxy for hardship, the hypothesis assumes inequities will be evident comparing Spanish-speaking communities than less vulnerable communities.<br /><br />
Methods: A literature review informed creation of an Equity and Bicycling Tool. The tool adapted the five dimensions of access – availability, accommodation, affordability, acceptability, and accessibility – traditionally applied to accessing health services. The tool was piloted in nine Chicago community areas: three predominantly Spanish-speaking, three diverse, and three predominantly English-speaking community areas. Observational assessments were conducted through a combination of walking and bicycling of approximately 1.75 miles of street in each community area. Descriptives, t-tests, and ANOVA comparison between community area groupings were conducted.<br /><br />
Findings: A total of 187 blocks were assessed, with an average of 20.8 blocks per community area. The predominantly Spanish-speaking communities had an average total score of 4.7; diverse communities scored an average of 5.7; and predominantly English-speaking communities scored an average of 6.9. The t-test observed statistically significant differences in availability, accommodation, acceptability, and accessibility between community area groupings.<br /><br />
Conclusion: Findings suggest there are less opportunities for bicycling in predominantly Spanish-speaking community areas than less vulnerable communities. Findings suggest that the tool could be promising to identify inequities across communities.<br /><br />

The presentation will discuss the challenges transit agencies face with operating and managing paratransit services: rising costs, increasing demand, and strict federal regulations. Additionally, paratransit customers increasingly want or expect their public transit services to operate more like on-demand mobility providers. The presentation will also provide an overview of strategies for cost management and service provision that transit agencies should consider to address these challenges. This presentation references several transit agency case studies to expand transportation services to people with mobility challenges and enhance the responsiveness and efficiency of these services to meet customer preferences. <br /><br />
The presentation highlight opportunities that can mitigate these challenges and reference case studies where these opportunities are in practice. These strategies will include policy changes in program eligibility, enhanced operating practices in scheduling and dispatching, and innovative service programs. The costs and benefits of the opportunities will be discussed.<br /><br />
 <br /><br />
Bronner developed a series of recommendations to improve operations, reduce costs, and enhance the customer experience for a paratransit program. The recommendations include examples of their successful implementation, potential barriers to implementation, and responses to those issues. These recommendations are broadly applicable to the paratransit sector and are representative of Bronner’s subject matter expertise in this sector.<br /><br />

Daniel Mihalov, Metra",Scheduling Commuter Rail in a PTC Environment ,"Positive Train Control (PTC) is a federally mandated safety system required for all freight and commuter railroads.  The system is designed to prevent certain types of collisions and derailments. While it will increase rail safety standards around the country, it will also impact train operations for the nation’s railroads going forward.  <br /><br />
Where PTC has been implemented, longer “flip” times have been observed.  “Flipping” is when a train reaches its final station and then departs as a new trip in the opposite direction.  Because engineers now have to initialize the PTC system as well as perform all other duties necessary to change ends, on-time performance and customer satisfaction have been impacted negatively. <br /><br />
This session will explore how Metra used its existing GPS data as well as PTC case studies to reconfigure its busiest line’s schedule to account for the operational challenges caused by PTC.  Initial analyses revealed that at least 30 “flips” on Metra’s BNSF Line were less than 10 minutes and would need to be adjusted in order to maintain schedule adherence once PTC was fully operational.  In addition, this presentation will address the lessons learned from this process and how Metra will move forward with PTC scheduling for its remaining lines.

Though the accuracy of this research is not clear, the conclusions are compelling nonetheless. Cities like Chicago must optimize their transportation infrastructure and reduce time travelers spend in congestion. Unfortunately, cities often lack the ability to measure and effectively leverage the price of individual travel decisions. The consequences of this inability to price movement effectively are known to economists as “uninternalized negative externalities”—welfare-reducing inefficiencies such as traffic congestion and pollution that are detrimental to society. Thankfully, innovations in telematics and data analytics capabilities are advancing substantially, allowing researchers to study mobility inefficiencies in cities like Chicago. For instance, by analyzing telematics data through an economic lens, we can see that the mobility behavior of Chicagoland commuters is highly skewed, often by predictable spatial and socioeconomic variables such as neighborhood median income and proximity to public transit. These insights may take us one step further to understanding both the direct cost and also the indirect price of individual travel decisions. These are just some of the insights telematics and analytics capabilities can generate. In this session, I plan to highlight some of the research we’ve developed over the last few months. By presenting the findings, I hope to engage in a productive dialogue with local researchers.

Chicagoland has made many micro-adjustments to the transportation system, using dozens of programs, in hundreds of jurisdictions. As a result, the problems of transportation-related air pollution, mode split- share, and funding equity continue to grow worse. <br /><br />
The root problem stems from high-paid experts and consulting firms making complex inputs that then make their outputs and action plans appear all-knowing and unquestionable.  <br /><br />
Approach –<br /><br />
I have applied a ‘macro-analysis’ approach to three major problems common to US and Chicagoland transportation: air pollution, congestion and infrastructure funding.<br /><br />
Step 1: Pick a transport subject of interest, learn from all sides of the question, and explore the literature to find the data that transportation agencies and constituents use to justify their actions. <br /><br />
Step 2: Look for and gather statements that agencies use to justify their requests for funding, and explore what they say we should do to resolve our problems, including what they say we cannot do.<br /><br />
Step 3: Survey US and worldwide alternative transportation solutions, to observe the ecosystem of each region’s transportation and explore valid options that solve our transportation problems and the social ills stemming from our seemingly intractable situation.<br /><br />
Step 4: Review cost-benefit analysis, or the lack thereof, for any hidden agenda, and expand the scope of such analysis.<br /><br />
Conclusion – <br /><br />
This 4-step macro-analysis method can avoid the micro-analysis trap and lead to innovative change. The presentation will demonstrate the method’s utility by revealing regional solutions to the three problems listed above.   <br /><br />

Research Methods/Project Approach<br /><br />
CTA and Pace staff propose to conduct a one-hour session, featuring two different but related topics of service planning and Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) solutions. <br /><br />
Service planning topic (20 minutes) – One Pace and one CTA presenter will discuss the process of developing cohesive service plans for the recently-completed North Shore Transit Coordination Plan. Discussions will feature how the plan’s service changes aim to reduce bus alignment duplication and provide overall better frequency, connectivity and span. <br /><br />
ITS topic (20 minutes) – One Pace and one CTA presenter will discuss the process of developing traffic signal priority (TSP) systems integration. Discussions will feature how TSP technology will improve bus service reliability and speed.<br /><br />

Findings and Conclusions<br /><br />
The primary learning objective of this presentation is to understand how imperative collaboration can be to the successfully delivery of public transit service. This would be accomplished by raising awareness of 1.) The extent to which our agencies regularly facilitate coordination, and 2.) How public agencies and the general public knowingly and unknowingly benefit from these types of joint partnerships.<br /><br />
These objectives will also emphasize the inherent value produced when agencies leverage and align their resources and expertise to forge a collective vision for providing public services.

However, funding is a constant setback for this project and expected construction has been postponed until 2022.

Matt McAnarney Illinois Department of Transportation ",Autonomous Vehicles in the State of Illinois,"The topic to be covered is autonomous vehicle technology and the State of Illinois policy on the issue. Autonomous vehicle technology has been rapidly expanding in recent years. In early 2017 IDOT Secretary Blankenhorn had indicated it was time for Illinois to be an actor in the field. He had ordered the department to lead the development of an interagency working group. The group’s goal was to develop policies that will foster a safe, innovative environment for the seamless deployment of autonomous transportation technologies. <br /><br />
In approaching this initiative, it was apparent that Illinois is not at the forefront of the technology, many states already have established testing programs. However, not being first had its advantages. The group was able to learn from the mistakes and successes of other states. When drafting the program, the group reached out to peer states, industry, municipalities, law enforcement, associations and federal partners for feedback. We believe we have created a testing program that is not burdensome to industry, while at the same time safe for the public.<br /><br />
A large hurdle that we saw was the lack of education on the topic. While vetting our testing program this became apparent. This will be an issue that needs to be addressed continually as we promote our testing program.  However, due to the lifesaving potential of this technology, IDOT feels it has a moral obligation to encourage the testing and future deployment of this technology on Illinois roads.<br /><br />

This research details a novel survey methodology completed at less than half of the cost of a traditional OD study. CTA, with RSG as the prime consultant on the study, conducted a 2017 OD survey effort with nearly 90% of the data compiled from surveys collected online, and only approximately 10% achieved onboard transit vehicles. CTA used email addresses from the Ventra system to recruit online respondents. With more than 85% of CTA rides made with a Ventra card, the agency was uniquely positioned to reach riders via email.

In Chicago alone, the number of vehicles registered for ride-hailing services quadrupled between 2015 and 2017. While some see ride-hailing services as an important piece in the mobility puzzle, others see a clear threat to public transit’s long-term financial viability. <br /><br />
With public transit and ride-hailing seemingly headed toward even more heated competition, it raises the question: which is better suited to meet our future mobility needs, the public sector or the private market? Will public transit agencies, with their ballooning infrastructure costs, be replaced by nimble technology-based services that only require a driver with a working vehicle and mobile phone? Or will ride-hailing services fall victim to their own success by adding even more congestion to our overtaxed roadway network and encouraging their customers to switch to transit?<br /><br />

Through the planning and design of the I-90 project the Tollway worked with stakeholders to modernize a traditional roadway project to maximize the benefits of a $2.5 billion investment. Coordinating with Pace and local communities, like Hoffman Estates, I-90 was designed thinking beyond just the personal vehicle. Through agency cooperation, the Tollway and Pace were able to create a partnership to bring a new successful express bus route and unique in-line station access to the region. With local communities involved in the partnership, interchange and transit facility decisions were made in accordance with local plans and visions. The Village of Hoffman Estates was one community whose involvement in the project process helped align the Barrington Road interchange and Pace transit facility with the Village’s economic development plans and bicycle/pedestrian needs. The Village is pursuing the implementation of plans for new development around the interchange which will benefit from improved access and expanded travel choices. Together the Tollway, Pace and Hoffman Estates have created a new model of government cooperation to improve mobility and economic development opportunities while rebuilding Illinois’ infrastructure.",Infrastructure; Public Transit; Community Economic Development; Inter-Agency Coordination ,Participants will learn how to successfully collaborate on public investments.,Participants will hear how to overcome the challenge of working across different agencies to implement joint projects.,This session will provide an inside look at planning a major infrastructure project for all users and stakeholders.

TBD - Uber/Lyft?;  Chicago city official?; think tank/NGO?",Congestion and Tax Policy,"There is increasing focus on congestion policy and how cities should best tax the vehicles on their streets. For example, Chicago recently raised its tax on app-based services (Via, Uber, Lyft) by 15/20 cents and has been applauded for using the funds to improve public transit in the city.  At the same time, Chicago imposes the tax on a per-booking basis and in way that fails to distinguish single passenger options (e.g., Uber X, Lyft, Via Private) and pooling services (Via, Uber Pool, Lyft Line).  This has the effect of disadvantaging pooled services (e.g., the city collects the tax 4 times if 4 people share a vehicle, but only once for a private ride), and the tax is also regressive (e.g., it’s an 18% tax on a $4 pooled ride). Some have questioned whether privately owned vehicles should also pay these fees.  <br /><br />
New York State is debating a congestion and tax plan for New York City right now, and by the end of March we will know what if any action they will take. This, and policies in other cities, may help inform Chicago’s approach. As evidenced by the Shared Mobility Principles for Livable Cities and a coalition letter to Governor Cuomo, companies, environmental groups, and transportation and policy experts are calling for change to existing city policies, which also have implications for an autonomous vehicle future. This panel discuss and debate how Chicago and other cities can best address congestion and the political viability of those ideas. <br /><br />

Prof. Zongzhi Li, Director of Transportation Engineering and Infrastructure Engineering and Management, Illinois Institute of Technolgy",Making light rail work on congested downtown streets,"Research topic/problem statement<br /><br />
Are there corridors in Chicago with enough bus ridership and traffic congestion to warrant investing in light rail? Can it run on downtown streets without getting stuck in traffic—and without shutting down traffic on the surrounding grid? How much would it cost and how could we pay for it?<br /><br />
Research methods/project approach<br /><br />
Working together with Mott MacDonald Engineering and the Illinois Institute of Technology, the nonprofit Chicago Streetcar Renaissance is studying a network of six of the busiest and most cost-effective light rail lines in America (https://www.chicagostreetcar.com/routes). The high-ridership lines would replace bus service in the city’s busiest corridors, running in dedicated lanes with signal priority at intersections to avoid getting stuck in traffic. <br /><br />
Using the high-fidelity TRANSIMS travel demand model managed by Argonne Nation Laboratory, Zongzhi Li is modeling the proposed light rail lines, bus route changes, and state-of-the-art traffic signal modernization strategies to maximize the flow of people (not vehicles) and compensate background traffic dynamically for each incidence of transit signal priority. <br /><br />
Findings and conclusions (lessons learned)<br /><br />
We find the proposed lines cost a small fraction as much to build as the L, and less to operate than the bus service they replace. With much longer vehicles (larger headways) than buses, and modernized signaling and data analysis, signal priority works without shutting down traffic on the grid. The proposal expands both the flow and capacity of people in our streets, speeding travel today and preparing Chicago for a future of growth without congestion.

With the backing of the Chicago Plan Commission, a body chartered by the city to promote the Plan, Burnham and Bennett proposed to beautify Chicago, segregate traffic, and provide for easy circulation with a new system of streets, avenues, and boulevards. But shortly after the publication of the Plan, unanticipated numbers of automobiles began flooding Chicago’s streets. How would the planners adapt? This question, I argue, reflected a protracted struggle among city planners over the proper role of the automobile—and of streets themselves—in the city. Challenges posed by large numbers of automobiles pushed the leaders of the Chicago Plan Commission to radically redefine their goals, often in explicit contrast to the Plan’s proposals. Instead of beautified boulevards featuring monuments and public art, the Commission proposed elevated superhighways; in place of the symmetrical street grid exalted by Burnham and Bennett, they argued for street projects intended to move cars quickly, regardless of aesthetics. These proposals prompted protest from Edward Bennett and others. As a result, the Commission fired Bennett in 1929, signaling its turn away from the Plan’s vision and toward a new view of the role of the street in the city.

Jonathan Slason (RSG)",Experiences Adapting and Applying Travel Models to Explore CAV Use,"CAVs could drastically alter travel patterns in ways that either alleviate or exacerbate congestion. Although there exists little data on CAV use, incorporating fundamental parameters into today’s travel models can serve several purposes. First, an understanding of possible futures from scenario planning or exploratory model analysis (EMA) can be valuable. Second, real data on travel behavior will become available during the lifespan of many current models.<br /><br />
This presentation shares approaches for directly and indirectly modeling connected/autonomous vehicles (CAVs). The presentation will feature two trip-based models and an activity-based model (ABM) with dynamic traffic assignment (DTA).<br /><br />
The first trip-based example shares a framework designed for the Michigan DOT. The framework accounts for changes in trip rates and lengths, mode and time-of-day shifts, and changes to roadway capacities.  It includes both privately owned CAVs and shared-use CAV services, and it represents five types of zero-occupant vehicle (ZOV) trips, making it well-suited to explore high VMT scenarios.<br /><br />
The second trip-based example shares results from an exploratory analysis of CAV scenarios conducted for the Chittenden County RPC. It demonstrates how reasonable assumptions for induced CAV demand could cause substantial increases in delay despite capacity increases. <br /><br />
The ABM/DTA example further demonstrates how EMA can be used to investigate CAV impacts. It shares insights that a more intricate model can provide, including supply-side analysis of early or incomplete CAV adoption. The EMA showed that network efficiencies may not be realized until widespread CAV adoption and unconnected AVs can cause inefficiencies.<br /><br />

Bikesharing, carsharing, ride-hailing and on-demand transit (microtransit) are new mobility alternatives that are disrupting the conventional transportation methods.  These innovative alternatives for travel are collectively referred to as shared mobility options provided by Transportation Network Companies (TNC’s).  The shared mobility innovations are transforming how people are moving within our cities.  This is a revolution that is reshaping the transportation landscape and is being adopted rapidly at a pace not expected.   However, these options are creating challenges for the street system.  Congestion, unmanaged use of curb space, loss in transit ridership, and reduction in walking and bicycling are some of the negative impacts.  Safety along the streets is also affected.  These rapid innovations are leaving public agencies to catch up.  Cities are experiencing challenges in managing the shared mobility options at a policy and planning level.  Delays in developing new guidelines for accommodating TNC services can make conditions worse.  This presentation will present factors to consider in developing a new approach for accommodating shared mobility options that will reduce congestion.  A collaborative approach is necessary to create an environment that promotes innovation without having a negative impact on our street network and transit.  Dedicated curb spaces are already being used at airports and tourist destinations to manage pick-ups and drop-offs.  A similar approach can be considered for the street network.

As a result, developing countries usually adapt to take advantage of new technologies and the experiences of other countries as soon as possible to minimize the costs. While the benefits of ITS applications make the compulsory socio-economic costs bearable, and available experiences of similar countries helpful, uncoordinated development of infrastructure, cultural differences, lack of law and the unsuitable organizational structure of agencies has led to numerous problems of different nature in the operation of these systems. Many different applications related to ITS that is of great importance for determining the problems in the road transport which is most widely used in freight and passenger transport in Turkey have been instigated.",sustainable; transportation; challenges; ITS,"review the existing applications in Turkey to<br />explore internationally accepted transport standards that are made in developed countries.",the benefits achieved by the implementation of the ITS new technologies in Turkey,"- ITS model implementing in turkey<br />- ITS Model is cost-effective, steady, competent and sustainable.<br />- it is of great importance for determining the problems in the road transport which is most widely used in freight and passenger transport in Turkey",Poster
